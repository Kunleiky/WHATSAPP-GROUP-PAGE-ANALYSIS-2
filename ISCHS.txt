Thank u for our visitors and
their children, who finished all my cookies and ice cream.🤚
Bless them so they won't come
again😏. Forgive our neighbor's son, who removed my sister's clothes and wrestled with her on her bed😔.This coming Christmas, please send clothes to all those poor naked ladies on my daddy's Blackberry😓 and provide shelter for the homeless men who use mom's
room when daddy is at work😕😖 °°°AMEN😌°°°°

7/24/20, 23:18 - +234 814 449 6034: 'IMPOSSIBLE'

I really don't subscribe with the term 'impossible', 
Even the word itself logically says "I'm possible", 
Almost nothing on earth now seems to be impossible, 
Lest you're of the doubt, my citing you examples is quite possible, 
Many things we see today I've once been presumed, impossible, 
But the introduction of technology has indeed, made a lot to be possible,

Commercialization of electricity was once said to be impossible, but thanks to Michael Faraday who proved it very possible, 

Flying people in the sky had sometimes been thought to be that, impossible, but kudos to the 'Wright Brothers' who repudiated this assumption and showed the world, it's possible.

Communicating with those abroad was once said to be impossible, but the advancement of telecommunication, now makes even video calls to be possible.

Can transportation from states to states really be as fast as possible? The modern vehicles of today, said "yes! it is possible".

Thomas Edison employed several methods of creating bulb but mostly all were impossible, however after thousands of trials he got the carbon filament which made it possible.

Knowing the position or gender of the baby in the womb; would  have been something of impossible, but Wilhelm Röntgen invented the X-ray machine which made this possible.

On the path of success many things will appear to be impossible, but with determination and hard work, they are much more than possible.

All that you've been supplicating for that ever seemed as though impossible, I pray that soonest, they are seen to be possible.

7/26/20, 17:38 - +234 814 111 6251: You are chatting at night with her
You suddenly feel horny
You quickly ask for a nude 
She says no
You continue
She asks you to understand her 
You tell her to trust you
She says she can't expose her body to anyone
You still go on.

She tells you to wait 
You wait patiently 
She sends it 
You feel happy 
You wank on it
You finish, you look at the nude again 
You feel disgusted 
You think its nasty after wanking on it
You then go to mobile uploads
You upload the pic with a nasty caption 
You even tag her
She sees it
She sends you a message for you to delete it, she cries and begs
But you say no‼ 
She tells you she'll send more if you delete that one
You say you've seen everything you wanted.

People start to like and react on the nude
Some start to comment bad things, some defend, some feel sorry, some laugh.
Her friends see the nude, some friends are disappointed and discriminate her, some friends defend her, but it does nothing cause everybody has seen the nude.

Some people share it
Some save and some even show her relatives 
She's toned she regrets she cries 
Next day she goes to school 
She finds some people booing her
She enters the class just about to sit, she's called by the head teacher 
She's told to explain what the head teacher and the member of stuff have heard, she fails 
She's beaten.

The head teacher call her parents 
They talk to the head teacher and the result is that she's expelled ‼
The parents try to plead but the head teacher is cold hearted
She goes home 
Her parents are disappointed, and they also beat her.

Her phone is taken away
Her life ruined 
She tries to take a walk just to think things through 
But as she's walking people point at her 
She hears them talking about the same thing
Some laugh
She goes back home.

Thinking too much 
She decides to commit suicide as a relief 
She goes to her mothers bedroom 
She gets the rat poison 
She quickly drinks it 
Within two minutes she's dead.

Her parents call for her 
She doesn't answer 
They are mad they call again, she doesn't answer 
They quickly go to her bedroom to beat her 
They find her dead with the rat poison beside her 
They feel bad, they blame themselves 
They cry, they regret punishing her 
They call her relatives and close friends 
Everybody knows and they feel sad 
Her best friend cries cause she can't believe what she sees.

The exposer also hears the news
He is toned 
He regrets, he feels like going back to time 
The burial day has come, her best friend and parents see the coffin lowering 
they all burst in tears 
They can't believe it.

Her parents are never the same from their daughters
Everybody close to her are not the same
The exposer is being haunted with force pictures of her.
It started simple until it was too much
You can easily ruin someone's life with something you think is simple.
Life is like electricity, Anybody can shock you.

7/26/20, 18:25 - +234 706 566 3856: WOMEN PLEASE BE CAREFUL
Share this message to any woman that you know. (If you are man and you receive this message please help forward it to the women around you), 

If a woman is seeing her menstrual period then please do not do these 4 things;

That is: 
1. Do not drink ice water, soda water, or eat coconut during menstruation. 

2. Do not apply shampoo on your head because the pores of the head are open during menstruation and it can cause headache (hit the wind head), it is very dangerous and this effect can be felt when young and later when aged . 

3. Do not eat cucumber during menstruation because the sap present in the cucumber can block some menstruation (blood waste) in the uterine wall and it can cause Barrenness!

4. In addition during menstruation, 
Your body should not be knocked or hit by hard objects, especially the abdomen because it can cause vomiting blood, the uterus can be injured. And these are the "ORIGIN OF UTERUS CANCER, CYSTS AND BARRENNESS

Research proves, drinking ice during menstruation can cause menstrual blood remaining in the uterine wall, after 5-10 years can cause "UTERUS CANCER OR TUMOR".

Please this info is distributed to many women; mothers, wives, daughters, or girlfriends. Show concern for others. Love your woman. There is Beauty in Sharing ... saving 1 woman, can get you an unexpected reward, this would be useful for women.

8/3/20, 21:50 - +234 706 566 3856: "MUMMY, CALM DOWN PLEASE"

When i was watching this video 2 days ago, i actually thought the boy was referring to his mum alone.

But, after some time, i got to realize that this boy is actually passing a message to you and I.

To those of us that have watched that video and you are condemning it for reasons best known to you. That is not my own area of concentration. My concern is on the message i got from the video.

That you are reading this now, you are the mummy in this article. "You must be calming down" to read this please (smiles).

Mummy, what is that challenge you are going through and you think it's over?..... please, calm down.

Is it your marriage that is giving you tough time and you think yours is the worst?.... Please, calm down

You are working like an elephant and you are eating like a rat. Your financial status is a threat to your life..... Just calm down please.

You've graduated for months/years and there is no comfortable job coming forth?... Don't be surprise if i still tell you to just calm down.

Pressure is all over you. Your friends are already getting married and you are still single. In fact, your younger ones are already carrying the title 'Mrs'....... Ma, just calm down.

You've being married for years and no issue at all. Or, miscarriage is the end product of every of your pregnancy..... Yes, Just calm down.

People are already mocking you and they are calling you all sorts of name because of your present situation. You are not the first person. Hannah and many others were mocked too......... Just calm down please.

You've being nursing a particular sickness or ailment for a very long time. Now you wish death is better than stress and pain. Do you know that, when you still have life, you have hope? ...... Sweetie, calm down please.

The list goes endless but whatever may be your own trouble(either stated or not). Jesus is still in that boat. He is not asleep. He can still calm the storm. So, you need to just calm down.

Mummy, calm down and rest like this🛌

No matter the amount of prayers you've rendered, just keep your faith alive. Don't fail your faith at the very minute you are about to get a solution.
Let your trust in God be awake. God has never retired from his duty.

If every human being are ask to drop our problems on a table and exchange it with others, i am very sure most of us will gently pick back his/her own problem and leave quietly. 

No perfect life any where so my dear, calm down and stop wearing sorrowful face all the time like the whole problem are on you alone. Nobody has it all.

People only tell and celebrate their success. When they want to celebrate their pain, they will tag it with "Admin, pls hide my ID" so you won't know they have pains too.

God knows about Abraham's childlessness. He knew about Job's predicament. Jesus knew about the storm on the sea even when He seems asleep.

Don't relent in tabling that situation before God timely. Hanna's story changed a particular day. That wasn't her first of praying or going to Shiloh.

That woman of 10years bareness in shackles part 1 by Mike Bamiloye, was  calm for much time but at the minute of God answering her prayers, she loosed her calmness, that was why she fell into the trap of that false prophetess. Thank God for grace.

Calm down and don't let your present situation to push you into everlasting regret. Your solution is at the corner.

However, your calming down is not a reason why you should exhibit nonchalant attitude in dealing with that situation.

Take goodly and godly steps while searching for a solution and don't let your steps be out of God's will.

That friend of mine once said "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light"

MUMMY, CALM DOWN PLEASE🙏. GOD STILL HAS YOU AT HEART. HE CAN NEVER FORGET HIS OWN. TO AVOID ENDING IN A DITCH, DO NOT RUN AHEAD OF GOD. CALM DOWN PLEASE

NB: Kindly give this widest circulation as the Lord give you grace without alteration. Thanks
8/3/20, 22:12 - +234 810 278 2990: Good evening to you all

❣ WHY NOT PUT YOUR PROBLEMS IN A BAG AND HANG IT ON THE CROSS OF JESUS CHRIST?❣

Because.. Only He Can solve your problems

See these words of assurance:⬇

 "Casting your care upon Him, for He cares for you"

👉🏻 Matt.11:28

"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest"

👉🏻 Phil.4:6

"Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God.

👉🏻 Philip.4:19

"But my God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus."

👉🏻 Eph.3:20

 "He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us." 

👉🏻 John 16:33

8/11/20, 18:39 - +234 902 673 2374: A friend used a ring which I believe they call touch and follow to lure me into the Bush which was meant for initiation
8/11/20, 18:39 - +234 701 035 2608: Ha
8/11/20, 18:40 - +234 902 673 2374: It was too late before I could come back to my normal senses.

But like I said, all thanks to God anyways.

But trust me, i love it here.

My dream growing up was to become a footballer, but when you get to some certain stage in life, you have to change cause the country is not the one that supports your dream.

So, Banking and finance was a course I chose without a second thought.

8/11/20, 19:06 - +234 902 673 2374: In my dream house

I’ll own my own firm
8/11/20, 19:06 - +234 902 673 2374: Yes when it’s fresh

8/11/20, 19:07 - +234 810 105 5758: Also, how were you able to interact with your friend after this incidence without getting yourself implicated?

Which mistake will u like to correct?
8/11/20, 19:08 - +234 902 673 2374: It depends
When you are not one of them and you see a child being forced, it’s better to just walk away and report to the nearest police station.
8/11/20, 19:08 - +1 (209) 407-5171: <Media omitted>
8/11/20, 19:08 - +234 810 204 5742: What do you mean by when is fresh sir

Once I see him like this I japa
Not until one night that he himself came to my house to come talk to me and tell me that I should stop running away from him again
But I begged him to pls distance me which he did

8/11/20, 19:14 - +234 810 204 5742: What can you say about distance relationship Mr Habeeb
8/11/20, 19:17 - +234 902 673 2374: I remember when I first landed in the Bush
The first person I saw was a Bro beside my house whom I call Egbon Egbon
I was shocked and happy cause I thought knowing him would help me out.
I shouted his name Egbon, Egbon, Emini, Bebo!!!

Guess what, he landed 2 hot slaps on my face.
He said I should shut up that for inside here, then no they sabi anybody.
8/11/20, 19:18 - +234 902 673 2374: Distance relationship is good for those that don’t fall in love too much
It’s not for people like us
8/11/20, 19:18 - +234 701 035 2608: Ok

8/13/20, 08:07 - +234 818 841 3201: Good Morning  ,
TO AVOID EMBARRASSMENT AND UNNECESSARY PRESSURE IN LIFE.

1. Put your kids in  
    schools you can afford 
    because expensive 
    schools don't  
    guarantee good 
    results. Just ensure 
    they attend a good 
    affordable school

2. Rent apartments you 
    can pay for
    conveniently. Don’t live 
    in a house you struggle 
    to pay yearly. If your 1 or 2     
    month salary or biz profit  
    can't pay for your 
    accommodation, that 
    accommodation is not for 
    your level.

3. A man whose wife is 
    pregnant has good 9 
    months to prepare, 
    same as the pregnant 
    woman in question. 
    They should even plan 
    for the worse and only 
    seek help when they 
    can’t meet up.

4. Some problems in our 
    lives don’t just pop up, 
    if you don't own a 
    home, we knew we 
    would pay rents...So its 
    not an emergency.

5. Let’s plan our lives and 
    live within our means. 
    Save more and spend 
    less and Invest wisely. 
    Never invest in something
    that will make you rich 
    overnight. No seed grows 
    to a tree overnight and 
    provide fruits, not even 
    tomatoes 🍅.

6. Some women buy food 
    for their children every 
    morning before going 
    to school or even for 
    the whole family, do 
    you know it’s cheaper 
    to cook at home?

7. Some people don’t 
    earn much, but have 
    DSTV at home, go for 
    GOTV and upgrade 
    when your income 
    upgrades. It’s still the 
    same CNN anyway! 
    Besides, most people pay 
    for cable subscription they 
    don't have light or time to 
    watch.

8. Eat healthy meals and 
    protect your family 
    from mosquitoes to 
    avoid going to the 
    hospital always. Sleep 
    under mosquito treated 
    net, saves you cost of 
     treatment on malaria.

9. Take advantage of 
    food and fruits in 
    season, its cheaper 
    and you can be 
    creative to create 
    amazing meals. Every fruit 
    in each season is meant to 
    help your body fight 
    sickness or health 
    challenges in that season.

10.Don’t copy your 
     neighbor’s lifestyle, 
     she earns well and her 
     husband is a ‘big 
     man’*

11. Don’t follow trends, 
       wear clean well-
       ironed clothes and 
       keep your hair neat. 
       You would still look 
       good.

12. Keep your circle 
       small, keep only 
       friends that have 
       senses!

13. Above all things, have 
      the fear of God, have 
      integrity, don’t be lazy 
      and be prayerful.

14. Planning is the key, if 
       you fail to plan, you 
       plan to FAIL.

15. Don't do more than 
      your budget this  
      year, there is no 
      award given to best 
      family that wore an 
      expensive cloth for 
      the year🤷🏻‍♂.

16.Don't be in 
     competition with 
     anyone...
     The purpose of shoes 
     and clothes are to cover  our nakedness, make us smart and 
 good.

 *Good morning*

8/16/20, 17:59 - +234 818 841 3201: *Let's all be citizens* 

Idiots, Tribesmen or Citizens !

1. Unless you understand your role in society, you can never make any meaningful contribution. According to the Greeks there are three types of people on earth, the idiots, the tribesmen and the citizens. 

 Studies show only 10% of Nigerians are citizens. The remaining 90% are either tribesmen or idiots. 

2. When the Greeks used the word idiots, they did not use it as a curse word. Idiots are people who just don’t care. If they write exams they will cheat, if they are in government they will steal, an idiot does not care at all, if he eats banana he throws the peels anywhere instead of putting it in trash, according to the Greeks, some societies have more idiots than tribesmen and citizens. 

3. The next set of people are tribesmen, these are people that look at everything from the point of view of the tribe. These are people that believe in you only if you are part of the tribe. It can be terrible to have a tribesman as a leader, he will alienate the rest. When the Greeks talk about tribes, it’s not just about ethnicity, they also consider religion as a tribe, a great percentage of Nigerians are tribesmen, because they  view everything from the point of view of the tribe, they trust only tribesmen. 

4. The last group are citizens. These are people that like to do things the right way. They will respect traffic light even if no one is watching them, they drive within speed limit, they respect the laws, they won’t cheat in exams, in government they won’t steal, they are compassionate and give to others to promote their wellbeing. Citizens often promote projects that benefit everyone. The Greeks called this group the citizens. Some countries have more citizens than tribesmen and idiots, some countries have so many idiots. A tribesman can become a citizen through orientation and an idiot can become a citizen by training and constant enforcement of the law. 

But things fall apart if you elect an idiot or tribesman to lead you if he has not been reformed. 

Let's all be citizens or appoint only citizens to leadership positions.

8/27/20, 05:50 - +234 818 841 3201: Well, sorry about the way things are turning up but we must know that we are all into one thing or the other, everyone cannot be free at the same time. The best thing you guys have done is bringing us all together which is good enough and i can assure you that even if some ppl don't reply they read all chats so i will just say you guys should push on and never relent. It's not really easy to be a leader, we can now see that our leaders are trying.

Good morning.
Thanks for the bday wishes once again
Love you all.

Love is not a scam neither is marriage a nonsense. 
Listen carefully please, and try to read my utterance. 
Some spouses have yearned to be free, while others are longing for independence. 
One claims she's deficient in these, the other pointed that he's now being so careless. 
However, no couples are perfect then and  none ever till present, 
Our parents have tried in immense, for they exercise patience in excess. 
Their mouths and tongues do fight, but often come to alt in resilience. 
A good man complains not of everything he sees, a virtuous woman learns to seldom keep her mouth in silence. 
Many homes we admired would have sink; they rethink and mutually resolve their co indifference.

In South Africa, an 11 year old child committed suicide on his mother's birthday as a birthday gift to his mother. 
He left a letter saying, "on today's special day, I want you to be the happiest ever. everyday you used to say that happiness left your life the day I was born. You told me dad left because of me. So today, I want to change things. I want you to be very happy and live as if I never existed. You told me you'd never look at me with love but I always loved you and admire you as the best mom on earth. I hope one day you will think of me, I hope in heaven you will finally hold me and kiss me. The best gift I could give you is leaving your life as you've always told me you wished I was never born. I love you mom. Happy birthday".
*Please parents be careful of what you say to your kids.*
*Words do cut so deep 😭😭..... This is a lesson for abusive parents.*
Let our generation learn to be a better and different parents

9/16/20, 17:30 - +234 816 505 5815: Good day all,
Hackers have realised that, almost everyone is aware of their antics on account hacking and so had done the 2-step verification.
So they've stepped a bit further by doing this:

They will call you after they might have studied your personality and line of interest or after they might have hacked into any group you belong and tell you that, there would be webinar/seminar/workshop/conference/zoom meeting, etc., on your group, they will tell you to watch out for a code or an ID number that will grant you access into such meetings that would either be sent to you as a text message or into your WhatsApp account. 
After a few minutes, they will ask if you've received it and if you say yes, they will ask you to call the number out or send it back to them.
Pls, don’t call or send it back to them, just delete it immediately and block their numbers.
If you call it back, that's the code that would be used to hack your account even with your 2-step verification.
May God save us from fraudsters.🙏

 *Sent as received*

10/8/20, 14:05 - +234 803 617 2973: 🔥 *AFTER THE RAPTURE* 🔥 

 _By Apostle Joshua Selman_

Appetite for marriage will die. 
Appetite for job will die.
Appetite for admission will die. 
Appetite to be the Nigerian president or governor of any state will die...
Appetite for sex will die
Appetite for fame will die
Appetite for Riches will die
Men of God that missed it will be ashamed to come out from there houses because of shame of there members seeing them. 

Christians that missed it will equally be ashamed to go close those unbelievers they preached to but never gave heed to there message. 

I mean after rapture, those who loved motivational messages will dislike them with passion and shall seek for messages of salvation 

Bro after rapture, grace on its own accord will expire here on earth. Spiritual gifts shall beard because there will be no Holy Spirit to manifest them anymore. 

Those who were not raptured  will take home the belongings of those that where raptured if peradventure it happened in a church service. 

Those who never believed in rapture shall do so but it must have become too late. 

I said after rapture, those that missed it shall cry hysterically. 
.
People would love to repent but there will be no Jesus on earth to accept them. 

It is only sin that has what it takes to drop any man or woman on the day. 

Let us lay aside every weight and sin that doth so easily beret us.... May God Almighty help each and everyone of us....!

DONT LET SHARING THIS BE A BURDEN TO YOU...YOU DONT KNOW WHO YOU ARE SAVING BY SHARING

📍No, you are not going to the war front but, you are going  to use your weapon of prayer that is stronger than AK47.  
📖 *“In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, In the days of Jael, The highways were deserted, And the travelers walked along the byways. Village life ceased, it ceased in Israel, Until I, Deborah, arose, Arose a mother in Israel.*

   👉🏽There was danger in the highways  ( similar to what is happening in Nigeria right now) ..... until Deborah arose as a mother in Israel.  
‼️Arise my sister! 
📍Judges 5:12 says *'Awake, awake,  Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise .... '* 
✝ Beyond denominations, beyond sentiments arise and cry to God.

11/9/20, 21:14 - +234 815 779 7617: The Osun state police command has arrested two ritualists, from the arrest, some female body parts were found with them. The Osun state police spokesman said: at about 9:30pm.. a distress call was made by A hotel management where they had lodged. The management said a girl screamed twice and after that, no noise was heard again from the room. According to them the scream was like a girl calling for help.

According to the management when the guys were about going, they were asked to be escorted back to the room to see if everything was fine and why the girl they came with wasn't leaving with them.
The ritualist said everything was fine and the girl was resting in the room, that she was going to be out.But the hotel management insisted, even though they tried to escape , the hotel management were smart enough to had locked the premises and pinned them down. That was when they were able to gain access in the room and saw a pool of blood with some body parts removed from the lifeless female body which they tried escaping with in a bag, the spokesman said.

That was when the distress call was made and the police force took emergency response, and they were arrested.

During some further investigation by the police, it was found that the names of the apprehended criminals are Ayodeji Saheed and Tunde Obadimeji who both confessed saying its not the first time they are committing such and that they have killed more than 70 girls. They  specialized in getting female parts and one Abefe Sadiq pays them for each parts. #600:000:00 Six hundred thousand naira.  for one girl killed for him ?

They were asked further how they get these girls???
"getting the girls was so easy" "we lure them with money and fancy things"
They went further saying that "girls of this days are easily lured with those things" All they need to do is to get or rent a fancy car with cash they would spend on the girls, and that is all this girls fall. Then they are being taken to a hotel room where they are told that they would be having fun overnight but instead they are being slaughtered.

Meanwhile, the commissioner of police said that efforts are being made to arrest Abefe Sadiq, the one who contracted them to commit the heinous crime.

The CP also went further saying that information should be passed round to all female friends, sisters and colleagues that they should all be careful not to fall for guys like this, there are some out there who are meant to destroy lives he said.

He also sent a note of warning to all of these criminals out there to repent or the law will surely grab hold of them.

11/30/20, 11:09 - +234 815 779 7617: LAGOS BEGINS RECRUITMENT FOR AGRIPRENEURSHIP PROGRAMME

The Lagos State Government, on Tuesday, began the recruitment of eligible and interested candidates for the Batches 4, 5 and 6 of its Lagos Agripreneurship Programme (LAP) under its Agriculture-based Youth Empowerment Scheme (Agric-YES).

The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms. Abisola Olusanya, who disclosed this in Lagos today, noted that the programme was in furtherance of the State Government’s objective of training no fewer than 15,000 youths and women in the various agricultural value chains by the year 2023.

She pointed out that the one-month training exercise is aimed at improving capacity, creating wealth and employment in the agricultural value chains - poultry, piggery, aquaculture and vegetables.

According to her, the strategic inclusion of the LAP Programme would efficiently reduce unemployment, create jobs and alleviate poverty in the State, as well as attract and pay more attention to the creation of jobs for women in agribusiness.

In her words: “Following the training of a total of 400 participants under three batches of the Lagos Agripreneurship Programme, L.A.P, Lagos State will begin the recruitment and shortlisting of interested candidates for the Batches 4, 5 and 6 of the Programme”.

“The current reality and exigencies of job creation for the teeming youth population and attainment of food security requires that a more aggressive, strategic and efficient approach be employed in the training and empowerment of women and youth, if Lagos State is to achieve a significant reduction of unemployment, create more jobs and wealth and also significantly enhance food security in the State by the year 2023”, Olusanya said.

The Commissioner noted that the significance of the training would be the creation of 2000 Agro-Entrepreneurs who would, in turn, become job creators, promote food security, improve nutrition and general well-being of Lagosians, as well as create at least 4000 indirect jobs per beneficiary annually.

12/4/20, 16:56 - +234 815 779 7617: DIE EMPTY

The most beautiful book to read is *Die Empty* by Todd Henry.
The author was inspired and got this idea of writing ​​this book while attending a business meeting. 
When the Director asked the audience: Where is the richest land in the world?

One of the audience answered: The Oil-rich Gulf states.
Another added: The Diamond mines in Africa*"

Then the Director said: "No IT IS THE CEMETERY. 

Yes, Cemetery is the richest land in the world, because millions of people have departed/died and they carried away many valuable ideas that did not come to light nor benefit others. It is all in the cemetery where they are buried."

Inspired by this answer, Todd Henry wrote his book, "Die empty" where he did his best to motivate people to pour out their ideas and potential energies in their communities and turn them into something useful before it is too late.

The most beautiful of what he said in his book is: *"Do not go to your grave and carry inside you the best that you have*.
*Always choose to die empty.*

*The True meaning of this  expression, is to die empty of all the goodness that is within you. Deliver it to the world, before you leave*.

If you have an idea perform it.
If you have knowledge give it out.
If you have a goal achieve it.
If you have resources, assist the less opportuned.
Love, share and distribute, do not keep it inside.

Let’s begin to give. Remove and spread every atom of goodness inside you.
Africa is like this today because many leaders want to take power to the grave. Instead of good leaders to groom successors that will easily take over the reins from them, they choose to sit-tight and die on the throne of power.

Do you have a thriving family business you would wish to remain in the family for generations to come? Then groom family members and acquaint them with the nitty-gritty of the business. Don't take your knowledge to the grave. You may not bequeath the business to your direct children if none of them have the aptitude or competence to manage it. It could be to a nephew, cousin or even niece you know can keep the tradition going. It's not by force, our children must inherit our wealth when they are obviously not capable of managing it when we are gone. Pass it on to the deserving and go to your grave empty and happy.

Material acquisitions will not follow us to our graves so invest in those you know have the potential to contribute to the well-being of the society. Help that indigent child with scholarships. Set up that Soup kitchen to take some poor people off the streets instead of keeping sacks of food in your store as food for rodents.

We are as rich as those whom we have impacted. If you walked through this life and was known for only the great parties you threw, the choice cars you drove or the palatial mansions you built without any benefit to humanity, you will take your poverty of the mind to the grave where no one will remember to put a flower in your memory.

Start the race now. Let us Die Empty.
